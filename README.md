	 How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
Start by identifying requirements through discussions with users and stakeholders. This approach helps us gain insights into their goals and pain points. Various discussion techniques, such as interviews, surveys, and observations, can be utilized to uncover issues and develop solutions. 

Defining the solution enables us to set realistic goals and prioritize the most pressing needs. Creating user stories keeps the focus on outcomes and helps break down complex requirements into manageable tasks. We must gather user feedback to ensure their needs are addressed and refine the program as necessary, while also regularly updating the user stories.

	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

To effectively develop a software program, it’s good to begin with comprehensive interviews and user stories. This initial phase allows you to gather insights directly from users, ensuring that their needs and expectations are clearly understood. Next you can move on to planning and designing the program. This involves outlining its key features and functionalities, as well as employing diagrams or wireframes to visually represent how users will interact with the application. 

In the development approach, it's beneficial to use a modular structure, breaking the program down into smaller, manageable components. This method enables quicker iterations and helps in identifying and resolving issues early in the development cycle. Implementing Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, can provide a framework for organizing the development process through regular sprint planning sessions, daily stand-ups, and iterative reviews, so the team can maintain focus and adapt to any emerging challenges effectively.

Next, integrating regular testing phases into the development is essential. This is so that each component is rigorously evaluated during the build process, allowing for timely adjustments based on user feedback. 

	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

 Being a good team member in software development involves actively collaborating with others by sharing knowledge and communicating effectively. Strong team members are flexible and open to change, whether that means adapting to new tools, adjusting to changing project requirements, or shifting priorities. Respect and empathy are essential qualities for all team members, especially when it comes to giving and receiving feedback for continuous learning. Knowing how to problem-solve is also crucial. Lastly, reliability is key—team members should follow through on their commitments, whether verbal or assigned.
